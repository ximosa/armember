        <div class="card">
                  <p>After installation and activation of the plugin, check about basic configuration of ARMember plugin.</p>
                  <p>Go to the <strong>General Settings</strong> menu from the admin interface. Here you will get number of tabs such as General, Payment Gateways, Page Setup etc..</p>
                  <p>Let's check each option in detail:</p>
                  <h2>General Options</h2>
                  <h3>Hide Admin Bar</h3>
                  <p>This option is providing you a choice whether you want to show admin bar for non-admin users or not. If you have enabled this option, then admin bar will be hidden from all users except who have either 'Administrator' role OR selected roles in 'Exclude role.." select box.</p>
                  <p class="doc_image"> <a href="images/ARMember_hide_admin_bar.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_hide_admin_bar.webp" alt="ARMember General Settings" title="ARMember General Settings"/></a> </p>
                  <h3>Rename wp-admin Folder</h3>
                  <p>Here you have facility to rename wp-admin folder to prevent hacking and security issues. You need to be careful while changing this option.</p>
                  <p>When you enable this option, popup with important notices will open  as shown in below image. Please read all the notices before proceed. You will see one URL in this popup. Do not forget to save that URL. It will help you to rollback this change to default in critical situation. When you will run this URL, new wp-admin path will revert to default path /wp-admin.</p>
                  <p class="doc_image"> <a href="images/ARMember_rename_wp_admin1.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_rename_wp_admin1.webp" alt="ARMember General Settings" title="ARMember General Settings"/></a> </p>

                  <P> Before you enable this option, you should check your wp-config.php file and .htaccess file write permission. If both files will have write permission, then you don't need to do an extra effort, just enable this option, change wp-admin name if you want and save settings. You will be logged out automatically. Now your website admin panel can be accessed by only new name or https://yoursiteurl.com/wp-login.php</p>
                  <p>But, if any of the two files will not have write permission then in such case when you rename wp-admin and try to save settings, then a popup will open containing file change instructions as shown in below.</p>
                  <p class="doc_image"> <a href="images/ARMember_rename_wp_admin3.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_rename_wp_admin3.webp" alt="ARMember General Settings" title="ARMember General Settings"/></a> </p>
                  <p> You must need to follow each instruction strictly and only then after click 'OK, I did it' button. After this you will be logged out. If you press this button without doing change in files, then you will not be able to login again. If you will press 'Abort Renaming' button, then 'Rename wp-admin' settings will not be saved, but all other settings will be saved.</p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="alert alert_error"><i class="ts_icon ts_icon_info_circle"></i>If you have renamed wp-admin from other plugin, this setting will remain disabled. Also it will not work with Multisite. </p>

                  <p>Once you add a new field in sign up form and save the form, then those new fields having new 'meta_keys' will be added in the list of 'Preset Fields'. So you can use these fields directly in other forms too.</p>
                  <p> But once field is added in Preset Field list, any change in that field will not affect that preset field. These preset fields are displayed in Add/Edit Member page.</p>

            <li><b>Edit Preset Fields</b>
                      <p>Suppose you have added a dropdown labeled Gender in sign up form. This field have two values 'Male and 'Female'. Now you have saved the form. So Gender field will be added in Preset field list. Now suppose you want to add third option in this dropdown. let's say 'Transgender'. So you will edit the form and add new option for this dropdown and save the form. But this option is not added in Preset field 'Gender'. So in Add Member page you will see only two options 'Male' and 'Female'.</p>
                      <p> So if you want to update preset fields, then you need to click on this button. Popup will open containing all Preset Fields where you can change label and values of all preset fields.</p>

                      <p>All the fields you will add in any of sign up forms will be automatically added in the list of "Preset Fields" section of form builder.  Sometimes it happens that some fields becomes unnecessary so you will remove that fields from sign up form, but those fields will still remain as it is in "Preset Fields" section even if they were deleted, so you can add them in the form from Preset Field, if again needed in future. </p>
                      <p>But sometimes you have added fields for testing purpose and then deleted those fields from forms. If those fields will not be deleted from Preset Fields, then Preset Field list will be longer and longer. Also those deleted fields will be displayed in "Edit Member" page of administrator area. So you must need some way to clear these unused fields from everywhere.</p>
                      <p>For these, ARMember Provides <code>Clear From Field</code> setting in <code>General Settings</code>.</p>

                      <p> Suppose you have added a text box of "Address" in sign up form. So it will be also added in Preset Fields section. Now if you have deleted address field for any reason. But it still appears in "Preset Fields" section.</strong>

                      <p> From popup, you can select all the fields that you want to delete from everywhere. You will see some checkboxes remain disabled as they are default fields and cannot be deleted from sign up form. Checkboxes for other fields will be enabled only if that fields were deleted from sign up form first.</p>
                      <p> If data entry exists for any of those fields, then you will see "(Entry Exist)" in red letter beside that field checkbox.

                  <p class="alert alert_error"><i class="ts_icon ts_icon_info_circle"></i>IMPORTANT NOTE: <code>Paid Trial</code> is <code>not</code> supported with recurring plan in stripe. But you can manage such cases in ARMember by following the steps given bellow:</p>
                  <p>For ex. If you want to add $5 for trial period of 7 Day in a recurring plan for which billing amount is $20 every month. So, you have to create a subscription plan with 7 Day trial period from your Stripe account.
            When someone buys this plan, he/she will be charged $5 as one time charge and also $20 as a subscription charge for the first time only.
            After that he will be charged $20 only every month.</p>
                  
                  <p>Go to your ARMember Plan Page and create plan accordingly.</p>

                  <h3>Subscription Retries for Failed 3D Secure Authorizations</h3>
                  <p>As per new SCA regulatory, If a subscription payment fails due to authentication issues when using 3D Secure, the payment would not automatically retry based on your retry settings. Unauthorized payments are still considered active, as they are waiting to be authenticated and have not technically failed as payments.</p>
                  <p>You will need to enable the <strong>Send a Stripe Email to Authenticate</strong> toggle in your settings and configure the retry settings.</p>

                  <h3>Pre Populate Fields Support</h3>
                  <p>Often a form will contain several generic fields that many respondents will answer in the same way. Rather than making users fill in these fields, which can be repetitive and time consuming, you can pre-populate them with the correct information so that, when users open the form, these fields will already be filled in. To do so, you will need the form’s URL and the variable names associated with the fields they want to fill in.</p>
                  <p>Field values can be passed into a form by appending them to the form’s URL using the following structure:</p>
                  <code>baseURL?variable1=value</code>
                  <p>Replace baseURL with the form’s URL, variable1 with the <code>name attribute</code> associated with the field to be filled in and value with the appropriate <code>plan's ID</code> value. To fill in multiple fields, insert the ampersand symbol (&) before any additional variables:</p>
                  <code>baseURL?variable1=value&variable2=value</code>
                  <div class="example bottom_margin">
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            <pre><code>http://your_site_url/membership-setup-page/?subscription_plan=2</code></pre>
          </div>
                  <p>The result of above example will be like - the plan with plan id value 2 get selected.</p>
                </div>

                  <p>Here, Coupon code will work as "special code / Invite code".</p>
                  <p>If this option is enabled then user will get an option to add Coupon Code at time of registration and this will be a compulsory field. So, if you want to make a system to allow registration with some specific invitation code then this option will be helpful. </p>
                  <p>Once user get logged into system, this code will work normally as coupon code.</p>
                  <p>If you are setting an "Invite code" with some percent of discount (for example : 10%), then that code will work as both "invitation code" as well as it will give discount (10%) to that user on payment.</p>

                  <h3>Pre Populate Fields Support</h3>
                  <p>Often a form will contain several generic fields that many respondents will answer in the same way. Rather than making users fill in these fields, which can be repetitive and time consuming, you can pre-populate them with the correct information so that, when users open the form, these fields will already be filled in. To do so, you will need the form’s URL and the variable names associated with the fields they want to fill in.</p>
                  <p>Field values can be passed into a form by appending them to the form’s URL using the following structure:</p>
                  <code>baseURL?variable1=value</code>
                  <p>Replace baseURL with the form’s URL, variable1 with the <code>name attribute</code> associated with the field to be filled in and value with the appropriate field value. To fill in multiple fields, insert the ampersand symbol (&) before any additional variables:</p>
                  <code>baseURL?variable1=value&variable2=value</code>
                  <div class="example bottom_margin">
            <h5>For Example:</h5>
            <pre><code>http://your_site_url/arm_register/?user_login=abcd</code></pre>

                          <p>Users can also purchase a memberhip plan using available myCRED balance(points) in ARMember.
                            Let's see the step that how we can setup myCred as payment gateway:
                            <ol>
                              <li>To enable myCred as payment gateway, go to <code>ARMember</code>-><code>General Settings</code>-><code>Payment Gateways</code>. there you can see the option like <code>1 Point =</code>, that indicates that how many amounts you want to set for 1 point of myCred.
                                <p class="doc_image" > <a href="images/ARMember_myCRED_Settings_In_Payment_Gateway.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_myCRED_Settings_In_Payment_Gateway.webp" title="ARMember_myCRED_Settings_In_Payment_Gateway" alt="ARMember myCRED Settings In Payment Gateway"/></a> </p>
                              </li>
                              <li>After enabling the myCred, you need to display myCred as payment gateway at front-end side. for that you have to select myCred option from <code>ARMember</code>-><code>Configure Plan + Signup Page</code>. add/edit the Signup Form.</li>
                              <li>There you will see <code>Select Payment Gateways</code> section. from there you have to select <code>myCred</code>. That's it.</li>
                            </ol>
                            <p>After following above step, if you see the ARMember's Configure Plan + Signup Form at front-end then you will see the <code>myCred</code> at payment gateway selection section.</p>
                            <p>If users purchase a membership plan using myCred option as payment gateway then user does not need to pay money. instead of money, user's myCred points will be deducted.</p>
                            <p>Let's see the calculation of deduction myCred points.</p>
                            <p><strong>For Example:</strong> If plan amount is 10$. and you have set the value 0.500 for the option <code>1 Point =</code> from the <code>ARMember</code>-><code>General Settings</code>-><code>Payment Gateways</code>. so the number of myCred points will be deducted like: <strong>(plan price x 1 ) / set the amount for 1 point =.</strong> so in our example (10 x 1) / 0.500 = 20. so 20 myCred points will be deducted.</p>
                          <hr>
                          <h3>Display myCred Point in Membership Card</h3>
                          <p>If you want to display myCred balance(points) in Membership Card to your members then you can display by just selecting the <code>myCred Points</code> field from <code>ARMember</code>-><code>Profiles & Directories</code>-><code>Membership Card Templates</code> section. add/edit the Membership Card Template and there you will see the <code>Display Member Fields</code> option. from there you can checked or unchecked the field according to your requirement to display field to the users.</p>
                          <p class="alert alert_error"><i class="ts_icon ts_icon_info_circle"></i><strong>Note:</strong> myCred Field will display only if you have activated the <strong>myCred</strong> module form <strong>Add-ons</strong></p>

          <h2>Make Forms in ARMember and GDPR compliant privacy policy page</h2>
          <p>To make your forms like register form in ARMember GDPR compliant simply add a required checkbox field like 'Privacy Policy'.</p>
          <p>WordPress 4.9.6 released with a privacy policy generator which helps you to create a privacy policy page easily in your site. If are using older version of WordPress you may create a privacy policy page using other WordPress plugins.</p>
          <p>Create a privacy policy page from <code>Settings -&gt; Privacy</code>. You will see a link of <strong>Check out our guide</strong> where you can get suggestions by your plugins and themes for what content to include along with your policies.</p>

          <p>ARMember also adds policy guide line with information of what personal data ARMember collect, which can be helpful to add guide lines in your policy content.</p>

          <hr>
          <h2>Allow users to delete their account from your site</h2>
          <p>ARMember provides shortcode like <code>{arm_close_account set_id="SET_ID"}</code> which you can use in your page to let your users allow to delete / close their account and all of their account data. </p>

          <p class="doc_image">
              <a href="images/ARMember_close_account.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_close_account.webp" alt="ARMember Close Account" title="ARMember Close Account"/></a>
          </p>

          <p>Once user will close his account, all the subscription plans associated with user will be removed first and then user will be logged out. If user has any automatic subscription, then it will also be canceled before his account is closed.</p>

          <p>Users who have closed their account will be removed completely and all of their account data will be erased from your site.</p>

        <div class="card">
                  <p>ARMember provides support to installed ARPrice Plugin in your site. You can open ARMember "Plan+Signup form" or only "Signup form" on button click event of Pricing table by inserting ARMember shortcodes.</p>
                  </p>
                  <p class="doc_image"> <a href="images/ARMember_arprice_plans.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_arprice_plans.webp" alt="ARMember ARPrice Supprot" title="ARMember ARPrice Supprot"/></a> </p>
                  <p> There are two ways to allow member registration with pricing table :
          <ul>
            <li>Page redirection</li>
            <li>Popup Form</li>
          </ul>
                  <p>On button click event of pricing table, either redirect user to a page having ARMember registration form or configure plan+signup page shortcode for being register OR open a popup by placing ARMember external form shortcode.</p>
                  <p>Steps for integrating ARMember with ARPrice are as below:</p>
                  <ol>
            <li>Generate ARMember "Configure plan+signup" shortcode.
                      <p class="doc_image"> <a href="images/ARMember_add_shortcode.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_add_shortcode.webp" alt="ARMember ARPrice Supprot" title="ARMember ARPrice Supprot"/></a> </p>

                    </li>
            <li>Now edit your ARPrice Template and double click on button, If you want to redirect user to your "Configure Plan+SignUp" page, then add URL of that page in "Button Link" textarea.
                      <p class="doc_image"> <a href="images/ARMember_arprice.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_arprice.webp" alt="ARMember ARPrice Supprot" title="ARMember ARPrice Supprot"/></a> </p>
                      <p>You can hide plan selection area in "Configure Plan+SignUp" page by passing post variable <strong>hide_plans=1</strong>. Also to keep specific plan selected on that page use <strong>subscription_plan=plan_id</strong>, do not forget to replace {plan_id} with ID of plan that you want to keep selected as default plan.</p>
                      <p> To add post variables go to column setting by clicking on pricing table column, here you will find 'Post Variables' text area.</p>
                      <p class="doc_image"> <a href="images/ARMember_arprice_button_settings.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_arprice_button_settings.webp" alt="ARMember ARPrice Supprot" title="ARMember ARPrice Supprot"/></a> </p>
                      <p class="alert alert_info"> <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> Post Variables will work only if you have used "Button Link" in button settings. </p>
                    </li>
            <li>
                      <p>If you want to open "Configure Plan+SignUp" form in popup when user click on pricing table button, then add external type shortcode of it in 'Embed Script (e.g. PayPal Code)' textarea.</p>
                      <p class="doc_image"> <a href="images/ARMember_arprice_button.webp" rel="lightbox"><img src="images/ARMember_arprice_button.webp" alt="ARMember ARPrice Supprot" title="ARMember ARPrice Supprot"/></a> </p>
                    </li>
          </ol>
                  <p>You can show your membership plans with all necessary information as pricing table columns with attractive pricing table template and add ARMember form shortcode in each column button, add both post variables shown above, so when user will click on button, he will just see payment gateways and registration form if user is not logged in.</p>
                  <p>In this way you can user ARMember with ARPrice for beautifully presenting your membership plans.</p>
